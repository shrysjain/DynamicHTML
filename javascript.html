      <h1>JavaScript</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the JavaScript section. Here you will learn about JavaScript, what it does, how it is important, the basics of connecting and using JavaScript, and We will also use JavaScript on our document example from the HTML and CSS pages to make something happen when we press the button. Let's get started!</p>

      <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>JavaScript, or JS is the programming language used to create interactive functionality in a web document. JavaScript is a scripting language. Instead of a static website, JavaScript allows you to create interactive maps, timely content updates, and more!</p>

      <h2>What Can You Do With JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>With JavaScript, you can do some cool things. You can make your website much more interesting by making it no longer static.</p>

      <h2>Why is JavaScript Important?</h2>
      <p>A lot of the time, JavaScript does not really change too much about a website, but when it is there it is noticable. The main reason of the importance of JavaScript is that it makes responsive web design much easier for developers.</p>

      <h2>How Can We Even Use JavaScript With Our Website?</h2>
      <p>Just like CSS, there are actually multiple ways. We will cover the two most practical ones now.</p>
     
      <h3>Method One: External JS:</h3>
      <p>This is how to use JavaScript in an external file. First, you will need to create another file and give it the <span class="code1">.js</span> file extension (for example, "script.js"). This will be the file in which you write all of your JavaScript code. Next, you will have to go to your HTML file and go to the body tag. Unlike CSS, you link JavaScript in the body. Once inside the tag, you will need to insert this code:<br><span class="code1">&lt;script src="file.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>. Make sure to change the src to the name of your JavaScript file. Now, your file is connected to the HTML and you are free to start coding!</p>

      <h3>Method Two: Internal JS:</h3>
      <p>This is how to use JavaScript directly inside the HTML file. In HTML, we have a special tag called the script tag. To use the script tag, simply go to the body of your HTML file, and insert <span class="code1">&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>. Inside the script tag, you can write all your code and it will be applied to that document. Easy, right?</p>

      <p>As a scripting language, there is many ways to code JavaScript, and not really any correct syntax, since there is a lot.</p>

      <p>Let us use some very basic JavaScript code to load an HTML element so we can interact with it.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/LilJuiceBox491/279736dd12a41317b8e2dce1e08b801e.js"></script>

      <p>That is a super basic demonstration of JavaScript. Now, let us break it down.</p>

      <ol><p><span class="code1">const paragraph = Document.getElementById("p");</span> - This line of code goes inside the HTML document, and selects everything with the paragraph tag. It then saves it to a constant called paragraph. Notice how we ended with a semicolon. This is usually not required in JavaScript, but it is good practice.</p></ol>
   
      <p>Remember, this is NOT everything you can do with JavaScript.</p>

      <p>Now that we know some JavaScript, we can finally make something happen when our button is pressed! Here is some JavaScript code.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/LilJuiceBox491/5241f1fdb455aa4d139060199ec8946b.js"></script>

      <p>That is our JavaScript code. Let us break it down. First we create a function called toggle. In the function we get the demo class (which is a class we will create in the HTML code) and make it so that if the contents are not displayed, display it, and vice versa. Therefore, toggling the visibility of the element. Now we can see our final document and see what happens when the button is pressed.</p>

      <p>Look! When we click the button, another header appears, and we can toggle it!</p>

      <h3 class="footerbutnotfooter">Now you have finished learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From here you can go to many online tutorials or documentations and learn more. I hope you enjoyed the course!</h3>
